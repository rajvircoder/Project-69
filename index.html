          <p>I watched this movie and it is very funny and there is a sponge man who lives under the sea in a pineapple house.Here's a rundown: the show has 10 main characters, including the titular sponge. The others are: Patrick the starfish, who lives under a rock; a surly octopus named Squidward; Mr. Krabs, a stingy crab restaurateur; a whale named Pearl who is somehow the crab's daughter; a Texan squirrel in scuba gear, named Sandy; Mrs. Puff, a stressed-out pufferfish who is SpongeBob's teacher; an evil plankton named Plankton; Plankton's snarky computer, named Karen; and SpongeBob's pet, Gary the sea snail, who meows like a house cat.</p>

<p> "The Lion King" has been one of my favorite Disney animated films, so I was nervous about seeing Jon Favreau's remake. Surprisingly, from beginning to end, I found myself consistently enjoying this remake more than the original, and I had no problem with it. This remake absorbed my attention with it's astounding, dazzling visuals, and this is the only Disney lifelike remake that has no humans, and animals are my passion. Jon Favreau and his crew pulled it off so well, and how on earth did they do it?
